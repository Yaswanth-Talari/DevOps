What is a Docker container? Simple breakdown.
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
-Imagine your computer is a big kitchen 🍽️
You want to cook different dishes (applications), and each dish needs its own special ingredients and tools (like software libraries, settings, etc.).

Now, Docker containers are like tiny, portable kitchens 🚚🍳
Each container has everything it needs to make one dish:

Ingredients (code)

Tools (libraries, dependencies)

Recipes (configuration)

Why is this useful?
You can run the same container on any machine, and it’ll work exactly the same.

It’s fast, because it shares the main kitchen (your computer’s operating system) without needing a full new kitchen like virtual machines.

It’s organized, so dishes don’t mess with each other. One container’s mess won’t ruin another container’s recipe.

In short:
A Docker container is a lightweight, portable box that packages your app with everything it needs, so it runs anywhere, hassle-free.


Why Docker containers are Light-weight in nature?
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
--> Because, they do not really have a full operating system, and they use base resources from the operating system. But they do have a very minimalistic system dependencies and packages.
--> Container base images are typically smaller compared to VM image because they are designed to be minimalist and only contains necessary components for running a specific application or service. VMs on the other hand, emulate an entire operating system, includes all it's libraries, utilities and system files, resulting in a much larger size.
